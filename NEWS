addmtoolbox v0.3.01 =======================================================

* models with memory effects (model.type = 'memnoise') do now work
* full output for n > 2 cases now available for all model types ('standard', 'memnoise')
* start of flexible boundary implementation (user can now supply a boundary function with arbitrary number of parameters to addm_fit_grid())
* evidence accumulation function received an interface simplification (we pass a vector of parameters instead of passing parameters separately, that makes addm_run_() functions simpler)

addmtoolbox v0.2.29 =======================================================

* output.type='full' for multiattribute version now available
* If theta = 1, now optimized evidence accumulation functions are called during the fitting process (by trial and by condition)
* first bits of better error handling implemented (model called that is not implemented will now result in specific error message)
* many general bug-fixes

addmtoolbox v0.2.27 =======================================================

Enhancements:

* partial implementation of multiattribute fitting for two item case: all fitting functions work,
however it is not yet possible to get detailed model output (besides likelihood), likelihood plots that incoporate gamma and psychometric plots

addmtoolbox v0.2.26 =======================================================

Enhancements:

* visualize a single two item model run with the addm2_plot_modelvis() function
* find a new addm_performance_benchmarks vignette added

addmtoolbox v0.2.24 =======================================================

Enhancements:
* you now can use addm_generate_artificial() to create fake data-sets of arbitrary set-size with fixed fixation pathways (matching the example fixation_model() functions provided)
* you now have example fixation models included for the item general cases: addm_fixation_model_fixedpath() , addm_fixation_model_random(): can be accessed simply as before via the   fixation.model parameter in the addm_fit_...() and addm_run_...() functions. Will be called automatically if you provide data that implies more than two items.
* the fixation models now get supplied with a vector of current valuations on the screen (example: c(0,3), for 0 value on item location one and 3 value on item location two). This should be more useful for the user_supplied...() cases.
* by trial fitting for item-general case better tested now
