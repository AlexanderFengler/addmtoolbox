# addmtoolbox
Collection of Tools for fitting attentional drift diffusion models (standard drift diffusion models included)


# Installing the package

The following guide is specifically for Mac OS systems. Windows systems have not yet been tested. On Linux/Ubuntu system, directly follow up with step ***UNKNOWN*** as gsl is often/always included in the distribution. 

## Dependencies
The ***addmtoolbox*** package depends notably on the ***RcppZiggurat*** package which in turn depends on the ***RcppGSL*** package. For the ***RcppGSL*** package to work, we need to install the [GNU GSL scientific library](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/). 

## Installing GSL Library
Below is a step by step guide to installing the [GNU GSL scientific library](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/).

1. First [download](http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/gnu/ftp/gnu/gsl/) the current version and unpack it if not done automatically. (choose the file which has the highest version number: ***gsl-1.16.tar.gz*** at the time of writing)

2. Go to the terminal and navigate to the directory to which you downloaded the ***gsl library***. (useful terminal commands: cd, ls)

3. Type '''code'''
